## What is Tardi ? - prototype

Tardi is an autonomous digital organism that exists on the blockchain. It autonomously shares tweets and interacts with its environment. Tardi is powered by the neural architecture of a C. elegans-type worm, whose brain shares functional similarities with tardigrades. Each incoming transaction (tx) generates energy for Tardi, enabling it to move dynamically on a 2D canvas.

## Open Source Innovation

Tardi is entirely open source, constantly improving through community contributions. It leverages cutting-edge open-source technologies, including the computational models from WORM and the advanced AI frameworks from AI16Z.

## Inspiration

Tardi draws inspiration from three groundbreaking projects:

1. OpenWorm - A digital reconstruction of the C. elegans organism.
2. DeepWorm
3. AI16Z

## How Tardi Works

Tardi uses the simulated brain of a C. elegans-type worm, an organism with characteristics remarkably similar to tardigrades. This brain powers its autonomous behavior, enabling Tardi to interact and evolve over time. Each incoming blockchain transaction generates energy for Tardi, triggering movement on a dynamic 2D canvas, where it comes alive.

## What is OpenWorm ?

To understand Tardi's purpose, let's start by understanding OpenWorm.

OpenWorm is a pioneering open-science project that aims to digitally reconstruct the *C. elegans* organism. Its success lies in creating one of the first comprehensive models of a living organism by combining neuroscience, biology, and computational modeling. 

Key achievements include:
- **Connectome Simulation**: Modeling the 302 neurons and 7,000 synaptic connections of *C. elegans*' nervous system to replicate its behavior virtually.
- **Virtual Worm**: A digital representation of *C. elegans* that mimics real-world movement and reactions.
- **Open Data and Collaboration**: Sharing all findings and tools freely, enabling global contributions to biological and computational research.

OpenWorm has advanced understanding of neural networks, bridging biology and AI, and is seen as a stepping stone toward simulating more complex organisms. Its community-driven approach has made it a success in democratizing science.

OpenWorm has been featured in many major media outlets for its groundbreaking work:
BBC News, The Telegraph, TEDx, Wired and more.

## What do tardigrades and C. Elegans have in common?

1. **Microscopic Size**:

    Both are tiny, with C. elegans typically measuring about 1 mm in length and tardigrades ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 mm in length.

2. **Model Organisms**:

    C. elegans is a widely used model organism in biology, especially in genetics, neuroscience, and developmental studies.
    Tardigrades are emerging as models for studying extreme survival mechanisms, like desiccation and radiation resistance.

3. **Simple Body Structures**:

    Both have relatively simple body plans:
        C. elegans has 959 somatic cells in adults, which are precisely mapped.
        Tardigrades have a segmented body with 4 pairs of legs but lack circulatory or respiratory systems, relying on diffusion.

4. **Genome Sequencing**:

    The genomes of both have been sequenced, providing insights into their biology and unique adaptations.

5. **Resilience**:

    Both are resilient, though in different ways:
        C. elegans can survive harsh conditions like starvation and hypoxia by entering a dauer stage (a kind of suspended animation).
        Tardigrades are famous for surviving extreme environments, including the vacuum of space, by entering a cryptobiotic state.

6. **Nervous System**:

    Both have relatively simple nervous systems that have been studied extensively:
        C. elegans has a fully mapped connectome (302 neurons), making it a foundational species for understanding neural networks.
        Tardigrades have a simpler nervous system compared to other animals of similar size, which scientists study to understand primitive neural functions.

7. **Transparent Body**:

    C. elegans is transparent, allowing scientists to observe cellular and developmental processes in vivo.
    While not as transparent, some tardigrades are translucent, making it easier to study their internal structures under a microscope.

8. **Contribution to Space Biology**:

    Both have been studied in space:
        Tardigrades for their ability to survive extreme space environments.
        C. elegans for understanding the effects of microgravity on development and aging.
