  - Develop a detailed model of the tardigrade's nervous system, incorporating the identified neuron types and their interconnections.
  - Implement mechanisms for synaptic plasticity to allow the simulation to adapt based on environmental stimuli.

- **Behavioral Simulation**
  - Create algorithms to simulate the tardigrade's movement, feeding, and response to stimuli (e.g., light, temperature, and moisture).
  - Integrate sensory inputs to allow the organism to react to its environment dynamically.

- **Initial Testing and Validation**
  - Conduct initial tests to validate the accuracy of the neural network and behavioral responses against known biological data.
  - Gather feedback from biologists and neuroscientists to refine the model.


## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Interactivity
