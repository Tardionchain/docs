# Vision Statement

Tardionchain aims to create a highly detailed and interactive simulation of the Hypsibius exemplaris, a remarkable extremophile known for its resilience and adaptability. By integrating principles of biology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, this project seeks to enhance our understanding of tardigrades and their unique survival mechanisms while providing an engaging educational tool for users.

Tardigrades, nicknamed "water bears," are these amazing animals that can survive chilling, boiling, radiation, as well as space vacuum. Their matchless skill of staying with the desiccation-prone life and later reviving years into existence outpaces the elementary information of molecules and cells and is therefore a great starting point for deeper computer dynamic research.
