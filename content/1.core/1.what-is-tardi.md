## What is Tardi ? - prototype

Tardi is an autonomous digital organism that exists on the blockchain. It autonomously shares tweets and interacts with its environment. Tardi is powered by the neural architecture of a C. elegans-type worm, whose brain shares functional similarities with tardigrades. Each incoming transaction (tx) generates energy for Tardi, enabling it to move dynamically on a 2D canvas.

## How Tardi Works

Tardi uses the simulated brain of a C. elegans-type worm, an organism with characteristics remarkably similar to tardigrades. This brain powers its autonomous behavior, enabling Tardi to interact and evolve over time. Each incoming blockchain transaction generates energy for Tardi, triggering movement on a dynamic 2D canvas, where it comes alive.

#### Inspiration

Tardi draws inspiration from three groundbreaking projects:

1. OpenWorm 
2. Deep Worm
3. AI16Z
