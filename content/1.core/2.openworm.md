## What is OpenWorm ?

To understand Tardi's purpose, let's start by understanding OpenWorm.

OpenWorm is a pioneering open-science project that aims to digitally reconstruct the *C. elegans* organism. Its success lies in creating one of the first comprehensive models of a living organism by combining neuroscience, biology, and computational modeling. 

Key achievements include:
- **Connectome Simulation**: Modeling the 302 neurons and 7,000 synaptic connections of *C. elegans*' nervous system to replicate its behavior virtually.
- **Virtual Worm**: A digital representation of *C. elegans* that mimics real-world movement and reactions.
- **Open Data and Collaboration**: Sharing all findings and tools freely, enabling global contributions to biological and computational research.

OpenWorm has advanced understanding of neural networks, bridging biology and AI, and is seen as a stepping stone toward simulating more complex organisms. Its community-driven approach has made it a success in democratizing science.

***OpenWorm has been featured in many major media outlets for its groundbreaking work:
BBC News, The Telegraph, TEDx, Wired and more.***

## What do tardigrades and C. Elegans have in common?

1. **Microscopic Size**:

    Both are tiny, with C. elegans typically measuring about 1 mm in length and tardigrades ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 mm in length.

2. **Model Organisms**:

    C. elegans is a widely used model organism in biology, especially in genetics, neuroscience, and developmental studies.
    Tardigrades are emerging as models for studying extreme survival mechanisms, like desiccation and radiation resistance.

3. **Simple Body Structures**:

    Both have relatively simple body plans:
        C. elegans has 959 somatic cells in adults, which are precisely mapped.
        Tardigrades have a segmented body with 4 pairs of legs but lack circulatory or respiratory systems, relying on diffusion.

4. **Genome Sequencing**:

    The genomes of both have been sequenced, providing insights into their biology and unique adaptations.

5. **Resilience**:

    Both are resilient, though in different ways:
        C. elegans can survive harsh conditions like starvation and hypoxia by entering a dauer stage (a kind of suspended animation).
        Tardigrades are famous for surviving extreme environments, including the vacuum of space, by entering a cryptobiotic state.

6. **Nervous System**:

    Both have relatively simple nervous systems that have been studied extensively:
        C. elegans has a fully mapped connectome (302 neurons), making it a foundational species for understanding neural networks.
        Tardigrades have a simpler nervous system compared to other animals of similar size, which scientists study to understand primitive neural functions.

7. **Transparent Body**:

    C. elegans is transparent, allowing scientists to observe cellular and developmental processes in vivo.
    While not as transparent, some tardigrades are translucent, making it easier to study their internal structures under a microscope.

8. **Contribution to Space Biology**:

    Both have been studied in space:
        Tardigrades for their ability to survive extreme space environments.
        C. elegans for understanding the effects of microgravity on development and aging.
