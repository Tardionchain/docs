title: What is OpenWorm?
---

OpenWorm is a groundbreaking open-science project that aims to create the first comprehensive digital simulation of a living organism - the *Caenorhabditis elegans* (*C. elegans*) roundworm. This pioneering initiative combines neuroscience, biology, and computational modeling to build a complete virtual representation of the organism.
