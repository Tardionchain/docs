   - Well-documented biology
   - Standard laboratory model

3. **Research Focus**
   - Basic neural function
   - Movement patterns
   - Behavioral responses

### Tardionchain (*H. exemplaris*)
1. **Neural Architecture**
   - Focus on key neuron types
   - Adaptive neural connections
   - Emphasis on survival mechanisms

2. **Organism Features**
   - Extremophile capabilities
   - Complex survival strategies
   - Environmental adaptability

3. **Research Focus**
   - Survival mechanisms
   - Environmental adaptation
